👋 **Hi, I’m Petr Michal!**  
I'm passionate about solving technical challenges and creating innovative solutions. What started as a hobby with my first steps in programming has turned into a journey I love. I enjoy building applications from the ground up – from design to implementation, using modern technologies.

💻 **What I work on**  
I've explored a wide range of technologies, including frontend frameworks like React and React Native, and backend solutions with Node.js and Express. I also enjoy working with tools like Figma to create user-friendly designs, and I have a growing interest in AI, especially with OpenAI.

🚀 **Currently Learning**  
Right now, I'm diving deep into AI technologies and exploring how artificial intelligence can make modern apps even smarter. I love finding new ways to improve and learning something new every day.

🏃‍♂️ **In my free time**  
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me spending time with my family, running, cycling, or hiking in the mountains. I believe in constant improvement and living by the motto: _"You can have results or excuses, but not both."_

Feel free to check out my projects below, and if you’d like to chat, don’t hesitate to reach out! 😊
