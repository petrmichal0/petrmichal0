### 👋 Hi, I’m Petr Michal!
I'm passionate about solving technical challenges and creating innovative solutions. What started as a hobby with my first steps in programming has turned into a journey I love. I enjoy building applications from the ground up – from design to implementation, using modern technologies.

Feel free to check out my projects below, and if you’d like to chat, don’t hesitate to reach out! 😊

##

### 💻 **What I work on**  
I've explored a wide range of technologies, including frontend frameworks like React and React Native, and backend solutions with Node.js and Express. I also enjoy working with tools like Figma to create user-friendly designs, and I have a growing interest in AI, especially with OpenAI.

### 🚀 **Currently Learning**  
Right now, I'm diving deep into AI technologies and exploring how artificial intelligence can make modern apps even smarter. I love finding new ways to improve and learning something new every day.

### 🏃‍♂️ **In my free time**  
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me spending time with my family, running, cycling, or hiking in the mountains. I believe in constant improvement and living by the motto: _"You can have results or excuses, but not both."_

## 

### 💡 My Motivation
I'm driven by the challenge of finding the best solutions to technical problems and constantly improving my skills. I aim to create applications that not only work well but also offer a seamless user experience.

### 🎯 Goals in Development
My goal is to deepen my understanding of AI technologies, like OpenAI, and integrate them into modern applications to solve real-world problems. I am also passionate about learning new tools and expanding my skills across both frontend and backend development.
